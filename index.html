    <h1>CHOOSE YOUR DIET</h1>
    <br><br>
    <h2>1.Intermittent fasting</h2>
    <h3>Intermittent fasting is a dietary strategy that cycles between periods of fasting and eating.
        Various forms exist, including the 16/8 method, which involves limiting your calorie intake to 8 hours per day, and the 5:2 method, which restricts your daily calorie intake to 500–600 calories twice per week.
        Weight loss: In a review of studies, intermittent fasting was shown to cause 3–8% weight loss over 3–24 weeks, which is a significantly greater percentage than other methods (2Trusted Source).

        <h2>2. Plant-based diets</h2>
        <h3>Plant-based diets may help you lose weight. Vegetarianism and veganism are the most popular versions, which restrict animal products for health, ethical, and environmental reasons.
            However, more flexible plant-based diets also exist, such as the flexitarian diet, which is a plant-based diet that allows eating animal products in moderation.How it works: There are many types of vegetarianism, but most involve eliminating all meat, poultry, and fish. Some vegetarians may likewise avoid eggs and dairy.</h3>
            <br>
        <h2>3. Low-carb diets</h2>
        <h3>Low-carb diets are among the most popular diets for weight loss. Examples include the Atkins diet, ketogenic (keto) diet, and low-carb, high-fat (LCHF) diet.Some varieties reduce carbs more drastically than others. For instance, very-low-carb diets like the keto diet restrict this macronutrient to under 10% of total calories, compared with 30% or less for other types.How it works: Low-carb diets restrict your carb intake in favor of protein and fat.They’re typically higher in protein than low-fat diets, which is important, as protein can help curb your appetite, raise your metabolism, and conserve muscle mass.</h3>
        <br>
        <h2>4. The paleo diet</h2>
        <h3>The paleo diet advocates eating the same foods that your hunter-gatherer ancestors allegedly ate.It’s based on the theory that modern diseases are linked to the Western diet, as proponents believe that the human body hasn’t evolved to process legumes, grains, and dairy.How it works: The paleo diet advocates eating whole foods, fruits, vegetables, lean meats, nuts, and seeds. It restricts the consumption of processed foods, grains, sugar, and dairy, though some less restrictive versions allow for some dairy products like cheese.</h3>
        <br>
        <h2>5. Low-fat diets</h2>
        <h3>Like low-carb diets, low-fat diets have been popular for decades.In general, a low-fat diet involves restricting your fat intake to 30% of your daily calories.Some very- and ultra-low-fat diets aim to limit fat consumption to under 10% of calories.How it works: Low-fat diets restrict fat intake because fat provides about twice the number of calories per gram, compared with the other two macronutrients — protein and carbs.Ultra-low-fat diets contain fewer than 10% of calories from fat, with approximately 80% of calories coming from carbs and 10% from protein.Ultra-low-fat diets are mainly plant-based and limit meat and animal products.</h3>
